# Power BI Dashboard Project

## Overview
This repository contains a Power BI dashboard created during the "Tech - Hackathon" at YCCE. The challenge was to clean a massive, unclean dataset and create a functional dashboard within three hours using Power BI. Despite being new to Power BI, we completed the task and developed a comprehensive dashboard, which showcases our ability to learn and adapt quickly.

## Project Details
- **Hackathon Name:** Tech - Hackathon
- **Team Name:** Resilience
- **Team Members:** Shreya Shahu, Khushi Dabhade
- **Tool Used:** Power BI
- **Dataset:** Provided during the hackathon (included in the `data/` folder)

## Dashboard Features
- **Data Cleaning:** Processed and cleaned the dataset to ensure accurate visualizations.
- **Visualizations:** Created various visualizations (charts, graphs, etc.) to represent the data effectively.
- **Interactivity:** Implemented filters and slicers to allow users to explore the data dynamically.

## Files Included
- **`dashboard.pbix`:** The Power BI dashboard file containing all visualizations and data processing.
- **`data/`:** The folder containing the dataset used for the dashboard.
- **`images/`:** Screenshots of the dashboard in action.

## How to Use
1. **Download Power BI Desktop:** If you don't have Power BI Desktop installed, you can download it [here](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).
2. **Download the `.pbix` File:** Clone this repository or download the `.pbix` file directly from the repository.
3. **Open the Dashboard:** Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop to view the dashboard.

## Learning Experience
Although we didn't win the hackathon, we gained valuable experience in data analysis and dashboard creation using Power BI. This project allowed us to step out of our comfort zone and learn a new tool in a limited time, enhancing our skills in the data domain.

## Future Improvements
- **Refining Visualizations:** Further enhancing the dashboard's visual elements for better data representation.
- **Additional Data Analysis:** Incorporating more advanced data analysis techniques as we continue to improve our Power BI skills.
